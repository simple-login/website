    SimpleLogin was the best thing that's ever happened to me (and I assume it the same applies to others who have tried it out. :) ). I use it mainly to protect my main e-mail from companies that potentially don't respect GDPR laws or can't be bothered to.

    SimpleLogin is one of my favorite go-to products for privacy and security. <br>
    The premium plan gives instant access to custom domains, which allows you to manage all your custom domains with catch-all rules for example and use them on the fly. <br>
    The major benefit of using email aliases like SimpleLogin allows, is that in case of a data breach, it's impossible for the hackers to find your other accounts, as you would have a different alias for each account. <br>
    Breaches take place on a **daily** basis. And once your email account is in the wild, it will stay there forever. There is no way to get it back.<br>
    And for those who are wondering, you can even send emails from an alias straight from your email provider (like Gmail or ProtonMail), to always maintain your privacy even when exchanging with people via email.<br>
    I **highly** recommend using SimpleLogin, and I **highly** recommend taking the very generous premium plan. I have been using their service since a few months now, and I really can't recommend it enough.

- text: Definitely recommend for email lovers. Super useful when it comes to privacy. What makes SL stands out is that emails are allowed to send out. Keep up the good work, Son!

- text: SL is next to a DNS firewall & a password manager the most important service you can (and should!) use for upping your privacy game! I love SL and I'm using it daily. All my mails get encrypted and forwarded to my Protonmail with PGP encryption. I can't imagine an internet without it.

- text: A year ago I decided to use SimpleLogin as a means of containerizing much of my online presence, all part of a move to improve my privacy among other things. The simplicity of managing my various aliases is amazing, and it's great knowing that if/when an email alias is compromised or gets spammed, etc, I can just kill it with a flip of a switch and not have to battle with emails I don't want. Very satisfied with how that's working out for me right now.

    I've found SimpleLogin last year and subscribed to premium before my trial expired. In my opinion it's the first solution of this kind which is fully thought out through. I especially appreciate support for replies and custom domains. Thanks to the latter feature I was able to migrate my catch-all email domain to SimpleLogin and kill off some compromised aliases used only by spammers. <br>
    My only wish is if there were integration with password managers (especially Bitwarden), but that's not really a Simplelogin's issue. <br>
    Oh and did I mention it's fully open-source with nice documentation for self-hosting?
