- question: What is the maximum email size?
  answer: >
    The current limit is 25MB. For large attachments, we suggest using a file upload service and send the link instead. You can find some file sharing services that respect our privacy on <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/file-sharing/">Privacy Guides</a> <br>
    Another reason of having this limit is the PGP encryption is a heavy process, supporting a bigger size put an important load on SimpleLogin servers.

- question: I accidentally deleted an alias, can I restore it?
  answer: >
    When an alias is deleted, depending on your setting, it's either <br>
    - immediately put into a global <b>trash</b> and we make sure that it can't be reused. All historic information on the alias (the account that creates the alias, alias contacts, etc) are deleted to respect your privacy. <br>
    
    - moved to the global trash after 30 days. In the meantime, you can restore it. This is the default option. <br> <br>
    
    The above applies to all aliases created with SimpleLogin domains. <br>
    For aliases created with your own domain or provided SimpleLogin subdomains, you can always restore them. <br>
    

- question: Where are SimpleLogin PGP keys?
  answer: >
    Our PGP keys are on <a href="/pgp-key">PGP keys</a> page.

    If you enable PGP, all emails are signed with the <b>signer@simplelogin.io</b> key.

- question: How can I delete my account?
  answer: >
    At the bottom of the <a href="https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/account_setting">Settings page</a>,
        you can delete your account. This operation is irreversible and we have no way to recover your data.

- question: Can I use email aliases for important services like bank, government, etc?
  answer: >
    The short answer is yes you can. We use email aliases to run our business, manage our taxes, handle our bank operations and so far so good :). <br>
    A longer answer is the email protocol is designed to be highly resilient and an email is almost never lost. If SimpleLogin cannot deliver the email to your mailbox, we will notify you so you can take appropriate action.   You can also set up a secondary mailbox in addition to your primary mailbox that can be used as a backup.
