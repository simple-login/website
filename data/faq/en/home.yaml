- question: What exactly is an <b>email alias</b>?
  answer: >
    Email alias is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_forwarding">forward</a> email
    address: all emails sent to an alias will be forwarded to your inbox. <br>
    Thanks to SimpleLogin technology, you can also send emails <b>from</b> an alias. <br>
    For your contact, the alias is therefore your email address.

- question: I can use my plus sign (+) trick to create unlimited email addresses, why do I need SimpleLogin?
  answer: >
    Email subaddressing, also known as the plus (+) trick,  popularized by Gmail and supported by some email services, allows you to create new email addresses by appending "+" to your current email address. Says your email is name@proton.me, you can quickly create another address like name+facebook@proton.me for Facebook, name+groupon@proton.me for Groupon, etc. <br>

    Though practical, it has some downsides: <br>

    - You cannot reply from the + address: your real email will appear as the sender. <br>

    - The + trick is well-known and some websites don't allow sign-ups with email addresses that contain +. <br>

    - Using + trick doesn't protect your privacy: one can easily remove the + part to have your real email. If your + address appears in the data breach, your real address is probably also in the hands of spammers. You could check whether your email is leaked using website like <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">have i been pwned</a> <br>

    - By removing the + part, advertisers can link these + addresses together to have your browsing history. <br><br>

    SimpleLogin aliases don't have any of these downsides. You can read more about the pros and cons of using the + trick on <a href="/blog/email-alias-vs-plus-sign/">What makes email alias a better alternative to email plus sign (+)</a>

  answer: >
    SimpleLogin is the most advanced email alias solution and is in active development. Here are some differences between SimpleLogin and other email forwarding/alias services: <br><br>

    <ul>
    <li>Fully open-source: both SimpleLogin server and client code (browser extension, JS library, mobile apps) are <a href="https://github.com/simple-login/app">open-source</a> so anyone can freely inspect and improve the code.
    </li>

    <li>Covers all major platforms: Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension for desktop, iOS and Android apps for mobile. </li>

    <li>The only email forwarding solution that can be <em>self-hosted</em>, i.e. you could run SimpleLogin on your server. With our detailed self-hosting instructions and most of components running as Docker container, anyone who knows ssh is able to deploy SimpleLogin on their server.</li>

    <li>You can send/reply emails from alias. There's no limits on the number of sends/replies.</li>

    <li>Unlimited bandwidth. </li>

    <li>No ads, no tracker.</li>

    <li>Not just email alias: SimpleLogin is also a privacy-focused and developer-friendly <em>identity provider</em> that: <br>
    - respects user privacy <br>
    - is simple to use for developers. <br>

    </li>

- question: How SimpleLogin is different than temporary email services?
  answer: >
    SimpleLogin alias are permanent as opposed to the temporary email addresses created on services like <a href="https://temp-mail.org/en/">temp-mail.org</a>. 
    <br> SimpleLogin also doesn't store the emails, they are stored in your mailbox. <br>
    SimpleLogin is simply a different product for a different need.

- question: What is SimpleLogin's business model?
  answer: Our revenue comes only from subscriptions, that means the product will stay ad-free forever.

- question: What is <b>alias directory</b> or <b>catch-all</b> feature?
  answer: >
    These 2 features both allow you to create alias <em>on-the-fly</em>, meaning you don't have to open SimpleLogin to create a new alias. <br>
    Enabling <b>catch-all</b> on your domain allows you to use <em>ANYTHING@my-domain.com</em> as alias with <b>ANYTHING</b> being any word. The only limit is it has to have less than 128 characters. <br>

    <b>Alias Directory</b> is similar to catch-all, you can use <em>your_directory+ANYTHING@simplelogin.co</em> as alias. <b>your_directory</b> is the name of the directory you created.

- question: I receive an email forwarded to my personal email from an alias. How can I reply to that email? Do I need to go to SimpleLogin to initiate the reply?
  answer: >
    You can reply directly from your email client. Just click on the "reply" button, the reply will be routed via SimpleLogin and SimpleLogin will make it coming from your alias. Your personal email will stay invisible to the original sender. <br><br>
    Technically, the <b>From</b> header in your email is replaced by a special alias dynamically generated for each sender. When you reply, your reply is actually sent to this special alias and SimpleLogin will relay the reply back to the sender, making sure the email is sent from your alias. All information about your personal email address is removed during that process.

- question: What is a <b>reverse-alias</b>?
  answer: >
    A reverse-alias is a <b>special</b> alias that allows you to send email <b>from your alias</b>. <br>
    A reverse-alias is created for each alias you want to send email from and each contact you want to send email to. <br>
    When you send an email to a reverse-alias from your personal email, the email will be sent from your alias to the contact.

- question: Is an email alias permanent?
  answer: As a normal email address, an email alias is always there unless you delete it.

- question: Where are SimpleLogin servers located?
  answer: We use servers from Proton and UpCloud - a cloud provider based in Finland.

- question: What is the <b>custom domain</b> feature?
  answer: >
    You can bring your own domains into SimpleLogin and create aliases like <b>contact@your-domain.com</b>, <b>hi@your-domain.com</b>. <br>
    As you might have probably guessed, you can then use SimpleLogin to manage your <em>business emails</em> instead paying for an expensive solution like Google Workspace. <br>
    All our business emails (e.g. <b>contact@simplelogin.io</b>) are actually aliases ðŸ¤«

- question: What is our <b>subdomain</b> feature?
  answer: >
    Having a subdomain allows you to quickly create aliases on the fly, without having personal domain.
    For example, if you own the subdomain <span class="highlight">my-sub.aleeas.com</span>, you can make up an alias like <span class="highlight">mcdonald@my-sub.aleeas.com</span> when you are ordering a McDonald burger without opening SimpleLogin app.
