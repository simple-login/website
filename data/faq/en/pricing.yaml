- question: What happens to my aliases when I stop the subscription?
  answer: >
    When your subscription ends, all aliases you created continue working normally, both on receiving and
        sending emails. Concretely: <br>
    - All aliases/domains/directories/mailboxes you have created are kept and continue working normally. <br>
    - You cannot create new aliases if you exceed the free plan limit, i.e. have more than 10 aliases. <br>
    - As features like catch-all or directory allow you to create aliases on-the-fly, those aliases cannot be
    automatically created if you have more than 10 aliases. <br>
    - You cannot add new domain, directory or mailbox. <br><br>

    For example, if you have 100 aliases by the time your subscription ends, these
    100 aliases will continue receiving and sending emails normally. You cannot however create new aliases.

- question: What happens when I reach the maximum number of alias in free plan?
  answer: >
    If you are in the free plan, you cannot create new aliases when you reach the maximum number of aliases
        (i.e. 10 aliases). <br>
    Aliases that would otherwise be created automatically via the catch-all domain or directory feature also
    cannot be created. <br>
