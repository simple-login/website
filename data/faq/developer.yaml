- question: Why should I implement SimpleLogin on my website instead of "Login with Facebook/Google"?
  answer: >
    Do you know that Facebook and Google use these buttons to <a
        href="/blog/do-not-use-facebook-sdk/">track</a>
      your users browsing history so that they can provide more personalized ads? <br><br>
    As SimpleLogin isn't fueled by advertising and gives users total control over
    their data, we don't have any incentive to utilize your user data.

- question: Ok, got it. But how about the recent "Sign in with Apple" ?
  answer: >
    About Apple, they claim to not selling your users data to advertisers but being an advertiser
        themselves, how can we be sure ... <br>
        Apple can also be considered as an ad platform with their Apple Search Ads so better to not put Apple
        in a (much) higher position than Facebook or Google in terms of privacy. <br>

- question: Why should I trust SimpleLogin?
  answer: >
    All SimpleLogin code is fully open-source on <a href="https://github.com/simple-login">Github</a> and
    can be self-hosted. <br><br>
    Anyone can freely audit the code or setup their own SimpleLogin server. <br><br>
    SimpleLogin revenue is based on a transparent and sustainable model that allows us to have a
    privacy-first and tracker-free product.

- question: Do you plan to release a SDK to support native, windows, etc app?
  answer: >
    Yes absolutely! We started with the web platform simply because they can be used for mobile app as
    well via a Android WebView or IOS UIWebView. <br><br>
    We plan to provide a SDK and some examples for Android,
    iOS, Windows quite soon. Stay tuned!
