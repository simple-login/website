Thanks for using our products and services ("Services"). The Services are provided by Proton AG, located at Route de la Galaise 32, 1228 Plan-les-Ouates.

By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

In the rare case that additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) are added, additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

## 1. Using our services
You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. Any kind of reverse-engineering, without prior agreement, is prohibited. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.

Do not use any resource created within the Services for illegal activity. Using SimpleLogin email alias on illegal website is therefore prohibited.

We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

It is prohibited to use the Services to send spams, junk mail, bulk emails. It is also forbidden to use your aliases to forward spams from "spambots". Any activity that aims to deteriorate the Services email delivery capability is prohibited and can lead to immediate account suspension.

It is prohibited to use a disposable or forwarding email address to register for a SimpleLogin account or to use it as a SimpleLogin "mailbox".

The Services are provided exclusively to persons. Accounts registered by bots or any automated methods are not authorized and will be terminated.

Having multiple accounts on SimpleLogin is not considered an acceptable use of our service. Accounts must also only be created and maintained by their effective users (e.g. it is not acceptable to create accounts in somebody elseâ€™s name and later transfer credentials to that third party).

Abusive usage of aliases for third-party services is prohibited. For example, you shouldn't use email aliases for bulk signups on a third party website.

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any harmful behavior that includes but not limited to: sending spams, spreading viruses, repeatedly marking emails from SimpleLogin as spam.
